AN ANALYTICAL STUDY ON INTERPLAY BETWEEN
LANDUSE AND LAND COVER RECONFIGURATION AND
 LST: A MULTITEMPORAL STUDY USING
THERMAL MIXING APPROACH


To estimate impacts of changing land use pattern as well as increasing rate of urban imperviousness on urban land surface temperature and urban environment.We try to find out estimation trend of land surface temperature on temporal basis with relation to urban land use and land cover dynamicity.Estimation of urban heat island scenario.Estimation of urban environmental criticality in relation to land use/cover and LST interplay. Here we use

I choose Bidhannagar Municipality for my study area, a city and a municipal corporation of the North 24 pargana  district in the Indian State of West Bengal. It is adjacent to Kolkata and also a part of the area covered by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority.Here I calculate some temperature indices and find out the vulnerable/Critical zone of Bidhannagar Municipality of 1989-2020 years.
